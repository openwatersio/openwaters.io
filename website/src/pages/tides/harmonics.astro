      <h1>How Tides Work</h1>

      <p>
        Tides are the result of gravitational forces from the moon, sun, and
        other celestial bodies. These forces, combined with the benthic
        environment, create predictable oscillations in water levels that can be
        modeled as a sum of sinusoidal waves called
        <strong>harmonic constituents</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tide predictions are created by adding up the effects of potentially
        hundreds of factors like the location of the sun, the moon, and the
        benthic environment. These constituents are derived from analyzing past
        water levels.
      </p>

      <!-- How It Works -->
      <h2>Harmonic Constituents</h2>

      <h3>Single Constituent</h3>
      <p>
        You can think of each tidal constituent as a sine wave. For example,
        below is a single constituent, M2, or "Principal lunar semidiurnal
        constituent" for Monterey, California during the first week of January
        2018:
      </p>
      <div class="rounded-lg bg-navy-50 p-4">
        <TideChart type="single" />
      </div>
      <p class="mt-4 text-navy-600">
        If this constituent, which measures the regular effect of the moon on
        water levels, were the only one that affected the tides, then tides
        would go up and down in a regular pattern.
      </p>

      <h3>Multiple Constituents</h3>
      <p>
        However, once you add more constituents to measure more effects, it gets
        complicated. To simplify, let's take just four constituents and plot
        them for the same location:
      </p>
      <div class="rounded-lg bg-navy-50 p-4">
        <TideChart type="multiple" />
      </div>

      <h3>All Constituents</h3>
      <p>
        Just for fun, let's take a look at <strong>all</strong> the defined constituents:
      </p>
      <div class="rounded-lg bg-navy-50 p-4">
        <TideChart type="all" />
      </div>

      <h3>Combined Prediction</h3>
      <p>
        If we add all these constituents together, they cancel each other or
        amplify each other, leading to an accurate tide prediction:
      </p>
      <div class="rounded-lg bg-navy-50 p-4">
        <TideChart type="combined" />
      </div>

      <h2>Constituent Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Each tidal constituent is defined by three key properties that determine
        its contribution to the overall tide prediction:
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-3 text-navy-600">
        <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
          <span class="mt-1 text-ocean-600">•</span>
          <span>
            <strong>Amplitude:</strong> The strength of this constituent's effect
            on water levels, typically measured in meters or feet.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
          <span class="mt-1 text-ocean-600">•</span>
          <span>
            <strong>Phase (Epoch):</strong> The timing offset relative to an astronomical
            reference, measured in degrees.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
          <span class="mt-1 text-ocean-600">•</span>
          <span>
            <strong>Speed:</strong> How quickly this constituent oscillates, measured
            in degrees per hour.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Where Constituents Come From -->
      <h2>Where Tidal Constituents Come From</h2>
      <h3>Harmonic Analysis</h3>
      <p class="text-navy-600">
        Tidal constituents are derived by running harmonic analysis on observed
        water levels. This involves fitting sinusoidal functions to historical
        tide gauge data to extract the amplitude and phase of each constituent.
      </p>
      <h3>Published Data</h3>
      <p class="text-navy-600">
        Some agencies, like NOAA, publish tidal constituents that are available
        on their website and via an API. Other agencies do not provide
        constituents directly, but do provide data on observed water levels that
        can be analyzed.
