// MapLibre 6 locates its worker with `new URL("./maplibre-gl-worker.mjs", import.meta.url)`,
// which Vite rewrites to the hashed chunk URL, so in production the worker 404s and the
// map stays blank. Bundle the worker ourselves and tell MapLibre where it landed. Import
// MapLibre through this module so every map picks it up.
